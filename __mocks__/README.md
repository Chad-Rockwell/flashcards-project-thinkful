#Flashcard Study App


This app is designed to help students study.
This app has the ability to add, edit and delete decks from a database.
Within each deck you will have access to view the cards.
Cards within a deck can be edited or deleted and you can also add new cards into the deck.
The study page will allow you to view the front of the card and back of the card separately before using next to display the next card.
Once you have gone through every card in a particular deck, you will be prompted to either restart the study of the deck or return home.
Be aware that you must have 3 or more cards in a deck to use the study functionality.
